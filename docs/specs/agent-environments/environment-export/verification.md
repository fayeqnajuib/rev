# Verification

Verified base: 24574576e4fa74ff56eda965ae287555b7552c03, the tip of the environment-serve increment on fetched main b83b9caf (this increment builds on it).

The worktree carries the manifest-view, streamable-HTTP and serve increments
as commits on upstream main b83b9caf; this increment's changes are uncommitted
edits on top. Every check below ran as written on this tree after the review
repairs; nothing is reported that did not run. Timings are macOS
`/usr/bin/time -l` command accounting (elapsed, user, system seconds and
maximum resident set size of the command and the children it waited for) on
macOS 26.5.1 with Node 22.23.1, npm 12.0.2, Docker 29.5.3 and a Python 3.12.12
virtual environment holding `agentenv-framework 0.9.1334`.

## Review findings addressed

An adversarial review of the first pass found two should-fix findings and
seven nits; each was repaired at its owning boundary before the gates below
ran.

- The bundle README told the reader to run `agent-env run <name>`, which only
  works from the bundle's parent when the folder happens to carry the env's
  name. The README now says `agent-env run .` from the bundle root and names
  the folder's path for any other working directory; the services test
  asserts the new block and the absence of the old command.
- The lane verifier resolved `agent-env` and `docker` from `PATH` when the
  `REA_*` variables were unset. It now requires absolute
  `REA_AGENT_ENV_COMMAND` and `REA_DOCKER_COMMAND`, throwing the standard
  actionable message naming the npm script and that nothing is installed, and
  checks both paths exist; the workflow exports `REA_DOCKER_COMMAND` from
  `command -v docker` beside the virtual environment's `agent-env`;
  `docs/testing.md` names both variables and drops the `PATH` default. No
  Linux preflight was added, so the lane stays runnable on a macOS host.
- The brittle `assert.doesNotMatch(stdout, /failed/)` is gone; exit code `0`
  and the `tasks/smoke.json v<n>: passed` summary already decide the case.
- The inner `agent-env run` timeout is 15 minutes inside the 30-minute job,
  so a hung run ends with the verifier's failed receipt rather than the
  runner's kill; `docs/testing.md` says so.
- The pair was read twice: parsed once for authentication and re-read from
  disk for the byte-exact copies, so a file replaced between the reads was
  copied unchecked. `readEnvironmentExportInputs` now reads each file once
  through the regular-file reader, parses the value from those bytes with the
  shared UTF-8 JSON parser, and the command passes the same buffers to the
  export, which copies them; the refusals of inline JSON, a directory and a
  file that is not JSON are typed by role, and the spec, plan and both guides
  state the single read.
- The tarball Dockerfile left the 6 MB `rea-agents.tgz` in `/tmp` of the
  image; the install layer now removes it (`&& rm /tmp/rea-agents.tgz`),
  confirmed by listing `/tmp` in the built image below.
- The verifier passes `--sandbox local` as the design specifies; the spec
  records that the task's `sandbox_type: local` already pins the provider and
  the flag restates it.
- The verifier's import of the HAR builder from `tests/fixtures/` through
  Node's type stripping is kept and recorded in the spec's limits with the
  reason (no second copy under `scripts/`; the scope lists the fixture).
- Writes are not transactional; `docs/cli.md` now states that a host failure
  after the first file leaves the partial folder for inspection and that the
  next attempt refuses the non-empty directory, and the spec's limits say so.

## Setup

`npm ci` completed (exit 0; 373 top-level entries). `/usr/bin/time -l npm run
build` passed with 3 tasks successful in 7.60 s elapsed (14.81 s user, 2.69 s
sys, 3013410816 bytes); `/usr/bin/time -l npm run test:prepare` passed with 6
tasks successful, 3 cached, in 1.63 s (3.47 s user, 0.81 s sys, 400752640
bytes).

## Static gates

Every gate ran on the final tree after the last source edit, sequentially:
`npm run check:fast` (typecheck and lint with module boundaries; 2 tasks
successful; 5.28 s elapsed, 23.22 s user, 2.93 s sys, 4564680704 bytes);
`npm run format` rewrote nothing outside this increment's files ("Finished in
635ms on 4077 files"), and `npm run format:check` passed ("All matched files
use the correct format"; 0.87 s, 4.30 s user, 0.64 s sys, 224051200 bytes);
`npx knip` reported no findings (3.49 s, 5.04 s user, 0.72 s sys, 805191680
bytes); `npm run verify:test-discovery` reported "Discovered all 1597 test
files exactly once" (0.55 s, 0.38 s user, 0.14 s sys, 141492224 bytes);
`npm run check:ci:tasks` (typecheck, lint:built, format:check, knip,
metadata:check, jscpd, scan:todos) passed with 8 tasks successful, lint "3764
files, 0 errors, 1690 warnings" and jscpd "3171 files, 2587 clones, 3.34%
duplicated lines" under the 3.5% threshold (4.89 s elapsed, 15.19 s user,
3.86 s sys, 874627072 bytes); `npm run docs:check` passed including the README
consistency test (6 tasks, 5 tests; 4.00 s elapsed, 3.86 s user, 0.94 s sys,
290111488 bytes). `actionlint 1.7.7` (`-shellcheck= -pyflakes=`, from the
review's scratch virtual environment) reported no findings on
`.github/workflows/real-agentenv.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. A
case-insensitive grep for the forbidden words and marker comments over the 23
new or modified files matched only the `scan:todos` script name in
`package.json` and this file.

## Test projects

Source group: `/usr/bin/time -l npx vitest run --project services --project
conformance` passed 122 files, 1524 tests in 11.08 s elapsed, 23.10 s user,
2.24 s sys, 1631240192 bytes. The increment's files are
`environmentBundle.test.ts` (7 tests: the planned file set and copy targets,
the registry Dockerfile pinned to `PACKAGE_METADATA.version` with the
readiness-probe layer, the tarball Dockerfile installing and removing
`/tmp/rea-agents.tgz`, the verifier text naming `get_annotations` as the
first parameterless `GET` tool with recorded status 200 of record 25, the
smoke task, the README's provenance, `agent-env run .` block and rights note,
the name override and six refused names), `environmentExport.test.ts` (6
tests: the reader returning each file's bytes and parsed value, its refusals
of inline JSON, a directory and malformed JSON by role, writing into an absent
directory with the read bytes copied unchanged and reported sizes, the
tarball copy, the refusals of a non-empty directory, a file path and a missing
tarball with nothing written, and an existing empty directory accepted),
`environmentSource.test.ts` (4 tests; the loader takes the reporting
operation) and the conformance test `environmentBundlePackagePin.test.ts` (1
test: the registry install line ends with `rea-agents@<package.json version>`
and never uses `latest` or a range).

Built group after `npm run test:prepare`: `/usr/bin/time -l npx vitest run
--project cli-boundary --project boundary` over `environmentExportCli` (3),
`ciChangeScope` (228), `ciRequiredLanes` (17), `workflowActionPinning` (5),
`ciCachePolicy` (6), `cliToolCoverage` (1), `cliStartupImports` (5) and
`ciTestProjects` (11) passed 8 files, 276 tests in 432.80 s elapsed, 303.47 s
user, 92.63 s sys, 422412288 bytes; `tests/boundary/filesystem/productCatalog`
passed separately (10 tests, 5.32 s). The cli-boundary file writes the folder
from the fixture pair through the built CLI and checks the seven written
paths, the byte-exact copies and the Dockerfile's first line and `CMD`;
refuses a non-empty directory leaving its one file in place; and refuses a
mismatched pair without creating the directory.

## Local end-to-end run

With the built CLI in this worktree, from a fresh scratch directory:
`inspect-web-network-capture grafana-like.har har --format json --json` wrote
capture Evidence `ev_4ee4759b…` (28 records); `inspect-analysis-view` with the
inline source and all three template rules wrote manifest Evidence
`ev_6553a8e5…` naming that parent, `grafana-example`, 19 tools, view digest
`8d1eb3ee…`. `npm pack --ignore-scripts` of the checkout produced
`rea-agents-6.6.0.tgz` (6039238 bytes). `environment-export manifest.json
--evidence capture.json <tmp>/grafana-example --package-tarball <tgz> --json`
exited 0 and printed `status: exported`, `tool_count: 19`, `package_source:
{kind: tarball}` and eight files: `README.md` (2076 bytes),
`envs/grafana-example/env.toml` (37), `envs/grafana-example/Dockerfile` (441),
`artifacts/check_grafana-example/verify.py` (1534), `tasks/smoke.json` (291),
`envs/grafana-example/manifest.json` (15701),
`envs/grafana-example/evidence.json` (58296) and
`envs/grafana-example/rea-agents.tgz` (6039238); `cmp` confirmed the two
Evidence copies and the tarball byte-identical to the inputs. The Dockerfile's
install line reads `RUN npm install -g --ignore-scripts --no-fund --no-audit
/tmp/rea-agents.tgz && rm /tmp/rea-agents.tgz`, and the README's run section
is the `agent-env run .` block.

`/usr/bin/time -l agent-env run <tmp>/grafana-example` exited 0 in 43.66 s
elapsed (5.19 s user, 3.26 s sys, 129318912 bytes), output

```text

```

`docker ps -aq` before and after the run listed the same three pre-existing
containers (a Grafana container, an exited container and the framework's
registry from earlier sessions, unrelated to this run); no container was
added, and the image count rose from 19 to 20 for the built env image
`5a5b3bf62aae`. `docker run --rm --entrypoint sh 5a5b3bf62aae -c 'ls -la
/tmp; rea --version; id -un'` listed only `node-compile-cache` in `/tmp` (no
`rea-agents.tgz`), printed `6.6.0` and ran as `node`.

`REA_AGENT_ENV_COMMAND=<venv>/bin/agent-env REA_DOCKER_COMMAND=$(command -v
docker) /usr/bin/time -l node scripts/verify-agentenv-environment.mjs` exited
0 in 37.24 s elapsed (10.42 s user, 4.45 s sys, 268533760 bytes) and printed
the receipt `status: passed`, `public_cases: 5`, `upstream: agentenv-framework
0.9.1334`, `runner: darwin arm64; host Docker`, `docker_before: {containers:
3, images: 20}`, `agent_env_run: {exit_code: 0, seconds: 32}` with the same
passed summary in its stdout tail, `docker_after: {containers: 3, images: 21,
new_containers: []}` and `process_lineage.status: verified` with no
descendants. The first hosted run of the lane, on a runner with no prior
framework state, created the framework's image-store helper `agentenv-registry`
(`registry:2`, container `b2e047f4c6cd`) during `agent-env run`; the run itself
passed (`exit_code: 0`, 354 s, `tasks/smoke.json v1: passed`, "Tore down 1
sandbox.") but the first form of the leak check counted the helper and failed.
The check now lists containers with their names, excludes
`agentenv-registry[-<port>]` and reports it under `image_store_helpers`; the
local receipt gained `image_store_helpers: []` because the helper already
existed before the run here. Public ECR's anonymous pull quota refused the
framework's `postgres:16-alpine` pull with `429 Too Many Requests, Data limit
exceeded` on two hosted runs out of six (the second and, after the stack was
rebuilt, the sixth); the verifier now retries the run once, after 90 seconds,
when the failure carries that registry's signature, and records
`attempts: 2` with `retried_for` in the receipt. The local receipt reports
`attempts: 1`. Removing that helper (`docker rm -f
agentenv-registry`) and running the verifier again reproduced the fresh-host
path locally: the run recreated it and the receipt passed with
`image_store_helpers: ["agentenv-registry"]`, `new_containers: []`
(`agent_env_run: {exit_code: 0, seconds: 33}`). Without `REA_DOCKER_COMMAND` the verifier exited 1 before
touching anything with "verify:agentenv:environment requires absolute
REA_DOCKER_COMMAND; see docs/testing.md. No dependencies are installed by this
verifier."; with a relative `REA_AGENT_ENV_COMMAND=agent-env` it exited 1 with
the same sentence naming that variable.

Refusals through the built CLI: exporting into the already written bundle
directory exited 1 with `invalid_request`, issue path `["directory"]` and the
message "is not empty (4 entries); choose an absent or empty directory";
exporting the manifest against the capture of one selected record
(`--record 0`, `ev_3249d233…`) exited 1 with `invalid_request`, issue path
`["evidence", "evidence_id"]` and "The manifest was projected from a
different capture than the supplied evidence file.", creating no directory;
a truncated `broken.json` as the evidence exited 1 with `invalid_request`,
issue path `["evidence"]`, reason `invalid_format` and "broken.json is not
valid JSON: Unexpected end of JSON input", creating no directory. An export
without `--package-tarball` wrote a Dockerfile whose install line is
`RUN npm install -g --ignore-scripts --no-fund --no-audit rea-agents@6.6.0`,
the `package.json` version, with no tarball beside it; the tarball variant
copies `rea-agents.tgz` and installs and removes `/tmp/rea-agents.tgz`.

## Independent review

The adversarial review of the first pass is the independent review of this
increment; its findings and their repairs are listed above. One further
observation surfaced while repairing them: the single-read helper routes the
export's input refusals through the export module rather than the CLI's
shared JSON-input parser, so the inline-JSON refusal is now a typed
`invalid_request` on the `manifest` or `evidence` issue path instead of the
parser's `input_path`/`input_reason` envelope; the cli-boundary tests did not
depend on that envelope.

## Scope and measurement limits

The framework readiness probe, the port variable default and the `env.toml`
name were found by running the bundle in the first pass, not by reading a
published contract; they are recorded in the spec as the three additions to
the designed file set. The local run and the verifier used the host's Docker
with the framework's gateway and service-database images already built from
earlier sessions, so the "first run also builds the infrastructure" path was
not timed here. The verifier's container check compares `docker ps -aq`
before and after; images built by the run remain by design and are only
counted. `npm pack --json` has the npm 12 object shape on this host and the
npm 11 array shape on the hosted runner; the verifier accepts both but only
the former was exercised locally. The hosted `real-agentenv` workflow was not
dispatched from this tree. The built projects ran on this host's Node 22.23.1
rather than the pinned 24.18.0. The `/usr/bin/time -l` figures account for
each command and the children it waited for; Docker's own work runs in the
daemon and is outside them. Windows was not run.
